# javacv-example
A sample repository to demonstrate the usage of JavaCV and CNN for gender and age recognition.

This repository has made use of CNNs trained by [Gil Levi and Tal Hassner in 2015](http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_agegender).

This simple program is capable of detecting human faces and predicting the gender and age of the detected face.
